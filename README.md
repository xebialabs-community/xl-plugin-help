# XL Plugin Help

## Overview

These documents intend to give you an overview of plugins and details of plugin development for XL Release and XL Deploy.

This is very much a work in progress and still lacking in many respects.  However we believe there is enough information here to make it useful even at this early stage of it's creation.

## Development

How to set up and use an environment for plugin development.

[XL Release Plugin Development](./docs/xlr_plugin_development.md)

## Kickstarters

These are empty plugins projects you can copy to your workstation.  They have the recommended directory structure and supporting files to develop and test your plugin.

## Other Resources

[XebiaLabs Community Plugins](https://xebialabs-community.github.io/)

This page has a useful overview of plugin development.  More importantly it gives instructions for TravisCI integration and using the nebula.release plugin for versioning.
